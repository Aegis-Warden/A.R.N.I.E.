### **Next-Gen OSINT, Amish-Engineered**

A.R.N.I.E. is an **Automated Recon & Node Intelligence Engine**—a no-vendor-lock, no-spyware, 100% analyst-owned toolkit to crawl, map, and triage *entire web networks* and the entities they try to hide.

Designed by and for real-world operators:  
- **Crawl any site** (government, shell corp, asset registry, darknet, or public portal)
- **Visualize the whole structure**—from top-level to the deepest outlier node
- **Color-code, focus, and slice** the data for instant analyst insight
- **Build actionable lists**—exportable to your team, backend, or reporting chain
- **All in your browser—no install drama, no backend snooping**

---

## 🚀 **Features**

- **Async Web Crawler**: Fast, respectful, robots.txt-aware, tags every node with crawl depth
- **Interactive Network Visualization**:  
    - Zoom, pan, and select the scope (slider from 10 to 1000 nodes)
    - Color nodes by keyword, crawl depth, or degree of connection
- **Node “Ego” Subgraph**:  
    - Instantly focus on any node—see all its direct connections in a pop-out mini-map
- **Analyst Triage List**:  
    - Double-click or select nodes to build your own exportable hitlist for further ops
- **Easy Export/Import**:  
    - Save/restore crawls, share edge lists, build up “case files” across sessions
- **Streamlit Dashboard**:  
    - Run with a single command. All controls live in your browser.
